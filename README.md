# VigenereCipher

Implementation of the Belaso/Vigenère cipher. 
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

The alphabet has 27 characters: the blank and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.
Given an encryption key and a plaintext, encrypts the plaintext. 
Given an encryption key and a ciphertext, computes the decryption key.
